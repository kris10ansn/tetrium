# Tetrys

This is not the code for my chrome extension (yet). This is a new version im working on. I made the extension when i was a beginner at programming, and therefore the code is really bad. When i get done this version will replace the old one.

## Versions

### 0.4.0
- Point system added
- GUI Changes and optimization
- Other minor changes


I have not written a lot about the updates until now, i'll try to get into the habit when i roll out newer updates.

### 0.2.4
