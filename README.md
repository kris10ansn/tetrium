# Tetrys

This is not the code for my chrome extension (yet). This is a new version im working on. I made the extension when i was a beginner at programming, and therefore the code is really bad. When i get done this version will replace the old one.

## Log

#### 0.5.2
- You can now press a key to restart when dead
- Space to pause/play
- Fixed bug where line would clear even after dying

#### 0.5.1
- Bug fix: When dead you could previously hit pause and then play to continue playing

### 0.5.0

- Added death system for when you go over the height limit

### 0.4.0

I have not written a lot about the updates until now, i'll try to get into the habit when i roll out newer updates.
