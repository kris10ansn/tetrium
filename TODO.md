# TODO

- [ ] Smooth rotation animation (have shape drawing that closes in on the real value exponentially in short motion)
- [ ] Move canvas functionality to GameObject class and only rerender when needed?
- [ ] Optimisations: lots of loops and calculations hidden in getters and setters +more
- [ ] Better line clear animation
- [ ] Landing animation like stacker with time before merge

## Issues

- [ ] Tetromino locks back in on x axis even when arrows pressed for short periods
